Revision history for Variable-Magic

        + Chg : s/require (XSLoader)/use $1/.
        + Fix : Tests are now strict.
        + Fix : Complete dependencies.

        + Add : Passing the signature of an already defined magic to wizard()
                now returns the corresponding magic object.
        + Add : You can pass the numeric signature as the wizard argument of
                cast(), dispell() and getdata().
        + Add : Any argument specified after the wizard (or the signature) in a
                call to cast() is now passed to the private data constructor in
                $_[1] and after.
        + Chg : $_[0] is now always a reference to the magic variable in all
                callbacks. The reason for changing from the previous behaviour
                is that one may want to apply the same magic to a plain scalar
                and to a scalar reference, and needs a way to distinguish
                between them in the callback (say, ref()).
        + Fix : Wizard object destruction used not to free the signature.

0.02    2007-07-27 13:50 UTC
        + Fix : In response to test report 548152 :
                Newx() and SvMAGIC_set() not present on older perls.
        + Fix : In response to test report 548275 :
                Since perl 5.9.5, 'clear' magic is invoked when an array is
                undefined (bug #43357). Moreover, 'len' magic is no longer
                called by pushing an element since perl 5.9.3.
        + Fix : Missing glob test in MANIFEST.
