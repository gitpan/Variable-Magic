        + Fix : In response to test report 548152 :
                Newx() and SvMAGIC_set() not present on older perls.
        + Fix : In response to test report 548275 :
                Since perl 5.9.5, 'clear' magic is invoked when an array is
                undefined (bug #43357). Moreover, 'len' magic is no longer
                called by pushing an element since perl 5.9.3.
        + Fix : Missing glob test in MANIFEST.
